 \section*{\large Course Description}

In this course we will learn how to ask questions about, collect data on, and analyze social networks. The study of networks spans many fields, from social science to physics to mathematics. Because of this we will often move from sociological theories of why networks are important to methodological questions about how to manipulate matrices. By the end of the semester though you will be able to investigate a social network, explain what its important characteristics are, and relate it back to social theories.  \\

\subsection*{ \large Student Learning Objectives} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Students will be able to explain and calculate important characteristics of networks.
	\item Students will demonstrate skill in collecting social network data and then visualizing social networks. 
	\item Students will be able to identify and apply the appropriate statistical methodology to test theories on social networks.
	\item Students will be able to apply network methodologies to contemporary political and social issues to identify the differences in possible solutions.
	\item Students will be able to explain the role of social networks in democratic life.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{\large Required Book}

% Course Policies. These are just examples, modify to your liking.
\section*{\Large Course Policies} \hrule 
\vspace{.25cm}
\subsection*{Respect} In this course we will learning how to test social scientific theories and evaluate public policy. At times this will require discussing issues that touch many of us personally. In these discussions our aim is to understand what the evidence implies about the world. In these discussions we will treat everyone with respect. \\

\subsection*{Preparation} This course builds on itself and so students need to come to class everyday ready and willing to learn. Most weeks we will spend one day in a lecture and another day working on assignments. On working days students are expected to bring a laptop and be prepared to actively engage in the assignment. \\


\subsection*{Technology} In the class you are expected to be focused on what is going on within the class. Laptops will be required on some days. On those days that laptops are not required you may bring one to take notes, etc. If the laptop becomes a distraction to those around you we will look at reevaluating this policy.  \\

\subsection*{Email Policy} I will check email between 8am and 6pm, and will try to always respond to any contact within 24 hours. Although I do not expect formality in email communications, I do expect you to respect that emails are not a costless act. \\ 


\section*{\Large Grade Distribution and Assignments} \hrule 
\vspace{.2cm}
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c}
	Item & Percentage \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Attendance} You are expected to come to class. You are given 2 unexcused absences without loss of credit. Additional unexcused absences will lead to lost points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0-2 unexcused absences: 5\% 
	\item 3 unexcused absences: 4\% 
	\item 4 unexcused absences: 3\% 
	\item 5 unexcused absences: 2\% 
	\item 6 unexcused absences: 1\% 
	\item 7 or more unexcused absences: 0\% 
\end{itemize}
In addition, you will still be expected to complete any assignments that you missed. These will be due one week after you return to class. You will be expected to contact me in order to get access to any missed assignments. Not completing a missed assignment because you were unaware of it is not an excuse. \\

\subsection*{Excused absences} In accordance with Miami University policy (\url{https://blogs.miamioh.edu/miamipolicies/?p=2046}), I must be notified in writing prior to any excused absence. These will not count against your unexcused absences. You will still be expected to complete any in-class assignments. As for unexcused absences you must contact me to received the assignment and they are due one week after your return to class. \\

\subsection*{Assignments} Throughout the semester we will work on assignments both in and outside of class. I will make it clear as I handout assignments how they will be graded. \\

\subsection*{Midterm} The midterm will take place on \\ 

\subsection*{Final} The final will take place on   \\

\subsection*{Extra Credit} I will provide extra credit opportunities throughout the semester and will announce them in class and on Canvas.\\

\subsection*{Groups} You will work with a group throughout this semester in order  \\

\subsection*{Late work policy} In order to receive a deadline extension you should contact me more than 24 hours before the deadline. If an assignment is turned in late without an extension but within 24 hours of the due date, your grade will decrease by 5 percentage points (a 95\% would become a 90\%). For every additional 24 hours after this it loses another 5\%.   \\

\subsection*{Online Work} In order to learn R in a hands on fashion, each week we will have an online tutorial in R. This work is NOT graded, it is solely designed to help you with the homework that will be due at the next class session.
